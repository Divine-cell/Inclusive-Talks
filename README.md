  Inclusive Talks is a youth-specific blog dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion. We serve as a voice for youths who are faced with discrimination.

  Our blog educates youths on the need for diversity and inclusion. We talk about the many forms of discrimination, how to tackle them, the need to check and control our biases, and several other enlightening topics.

  With a global reach of over 2000 individuals across our various platforms, we leverage our blog and social networks to educate the public on topics related to diversity and inclusion. We proudly serve as a leading voice for the youth. To date, our impact has extended to over 2500 individuals worldwide.
