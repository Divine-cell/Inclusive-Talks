                <p>
                    Growing up as a young child, I would sit with my mum and listen to 
                    songs ranging from gospel, country, reggae, RnB and they were mostly 
                    oldies. One of such songs I fell in love with was “signed, sealed, 
                    delivered, I’m yours” by Stevie Wonder, and my young mind was shocked
                    when my mum told me that Stevie Wonder is actually blind. I was awed 
                    by this man that despite his physical impairment, he was able to make
                    his mark in society as a music icon. We also have the likes of the 
                    celebrated Nigerian singer and music producer, Cobhams Asuquo and 
                    many others who are making waves in their various fields, not letting
                    their disability get in the way. Even with the wins of some, people 
                    living with disabilities still encounter numerous challenges that 
                    borders on how different they are and the stigmatization they face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    God, in His infinite wisdom thought it wise to create humans and because 
                    He has a great sense of humor, He added diversity. That is why we have 
                    people from different race, tribe, skin color, gender, body built, religious 
                    beliefs and even with special needs. Due to this diversity, we have experienced 
                    segregation and this has led to people clamoring for inclusion, but one aspect 
                    we tend to overlook has to be that of people living with special needs. <br><br>

                    According to the World Health Organization’s data, one billion people of the world’s 
                    population have one disability or another, while in Nigeria as at the year 2020, 
                    it was reported that over 27 million Nigerians were living with some form of 
                    disability. In Nigeria, the most common forms include, sight, hearing, physical 
                    impairment, intellectual impairment and communication impairment.<br><br> 
                </p>

                <img src="images/blogimg10.webp" alt="">

                <p>
                    Walking through the streets of major cities, towns and marketplaces, you would 
                    see physically challenged people begging for alms to alleviate their economic 
                    hardships and this is as a result of the barriers they face in terms of social 
                    and economic inclusion.<br><br>

                    The inclusion of people living with disabilities into society transcends beyond 
                    compassion which sometimes is just a display of pity, but it moves towards social 
                    justice which is actively considering and providing easy access to them in society. 
                    The needs of physically challenged people should be the forefront of conversations 
                    as a society, and more efforts should be made by governmental and non-governmental 
                    organizations.<br><br>

                    According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child in 1989 positioned 
                    education as a human issue, this means that all children have a right to quality education 
                    regardless of ethnicity, religious beliefs, gender, disability etc. This has not been fully 
                    achieved, as children living with disabilities have poor access to quality education and 
                    learning materials. Most schools and teachers, especially in Nigeria, cannot cater to the 
                    needs of physically challenged children and this has resulted in most low-income parents 
                    to forfeit the education of those special needs children.<br><br>

                    Most people living with special needs tend to be completely dependent on family for 
                    financial support and care, which happens because they lack appropriate educational 
                    knowledge and skills. A parent of a child with either ADHD or autism would find it 
                    difficult to place their child in a school that would accommodate their child’s 
                    needs, because not all schools have such facilities and trained teachers and the 
                    ones that might have them would be expensive, thereby making it difficult for 
                    low-income parents to enroll their children and wards to such schools. <br><br>

                    The Federal and State Governments should create more special needs schools and 
                    be involved in the training of special needs teachers. Concerted efforts should 
                    be made for the training and retraining of teachers, mostly in public schools 
                    to identify and accommodate children with special needs and learning difficulties 
                    that are in their classes. Also, provision of hearing aids, Braille educational 
                    materials and ease of movement should be of the essence.<br><br>  

                    After we have dealt with the issue of schools, we also have to consider churches 
                    and mosques. A few churches render the services of a sign language interpreter 
                    to attend to the needs of people with hearing impairments. People living with 
                    disabilities find it difficult to participate fully in religious activities. 
                    It should be the responsibility of churches, mosques, and other religious 
                    centers to engage the faith of their members by breaking down those barriers 
                    and promoting understanding and acceptance. Physical accessibility like ramps 
                    and restrooms should be considered when building churches and mosques. Sign 
                    language interpreters from those gatherings can volunteer their services. 
                    Braille bibles and other religious materials should be made available in 
                    Church bookshops for members to acquire. <br><br>

                    When constructing roads and public buildings like schools, banks, hospitals, 
                    offices, restrooms and shopping malls etc., people living with disabilities 
                    should be considered, so they can access these facilities with little or no 
                    assistance. Such facilities should be equipped with ramps, elevators, automated 
                    doors, Braille buttons for elevators, sound and visual aids.<br><br>

                    If as a society, we have been able to attend to the issues raised above, but we 
                    do not address our behavioral bias towards people living with disability, then 
                    we have not fully achieved our goal of inclusion. Awareness should be raised in 
                    how to treat people living with disabilities, the implementation of the Discrimination 
                    against People with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act 2018 in Nigeria should be forefront 
                    in our road to inclusion.<br><br>

                    As we move towards a more inclusive society, let’s remember that everybody has a special 
                    talent, regardless of disability and let’s celebrate our diversity just as Neil Milliken, 
                    Head of Accessibility and Digital Inclusion at Atos puts it, “we should celebrate 
                    neurodiversity, the world would be poorer and life duller if we are all the same.”
