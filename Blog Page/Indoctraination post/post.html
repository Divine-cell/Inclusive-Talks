                    <em>Alex, a devoted believer of a certain religion, works in a manufacturing 
                    company that upholds diversity and inclusion as one of its core values. 
                    Excited about an upcoming festival important to him and his religion, Alex 
                    invites his colleagues to join in the celebrations. To his disappointment, 
                    some of Alex’s co-workers politely decline his invitation, explaining that 
                    they belong to other religions, and their beliefs do not align with Alex’s 
                    religious practices.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Unintentionally, conflict arises when Alex, feeling disappointed, accuses his colleagues 
                    of discrimination. He argues that by not participating in his festival, they are disrespecting 
                    his religious identity. The situation becomes tense as misunderstandings grow, affecting their 
                    once harmonious workplace<br><br>

                    Fortunately, Sarah, a seasoned colleague, steps in to mediate. She brings everyone together for 
                    a candid discussion about religious freedom and understanding. Sarah emphasizes that respect for 
                    individual beliefs is crucial in a diverse environment like theirs. She reminds them that every 
                    person is entitled to observe their religion without being labeled discriminatory.</em><br><br> 
                    
                    Diversity is an intricate part of our world, encompassing a myriad of cultures, traditions, and 
                    perspectives that shape our global community. It is an irrefutable aspect that cannot be severed 
                    from our world, no matter how much we try. Diversity, being the authenticity of our world, needs 
                    inclusion to ensure individuals of all backgrounds, identities, and perspectives are valued, respected, 
                    and given equal opportunities and representation.<br><br>
                    
                    However, it is a matter of concern that the promotion of inclusion may lead to indoctrination, 
                    where certain beliefs or ideologies are imposed upon individuals, due to lack of understanding of what inclusion is. 
                    This article aims to give clear insight on the concept of inclusion, and make a clear distinction between inclusion 
                    and indoctrination.
                </p>
                 
                <h2>Understanding Inclusion</h2> 
                <p>
                    Today, inclusion has taken center stage as a major topic in our society. It has become a trend, 
                    even serving as the new advertisement jingle for businesses. However, it is important to understand 
                    that the word “inclusion” is more than just a buzzword<br><br>
                    
                    Our understanding of inclusion as mere tolerance is a shallow interpretation of this broad concept. 
                    Inclusion surpasses token gestures of tolerance. Rather, it is the genuine recognition and appreciation 
                    of differences in race, ethnicity, gender, religion, socio-economic status, and more which requires conscious 
                    efforts to create a culture of acceptance and belonging.<br><br>

                    The goal of inclusion is to foster an environment that not only acknowledges 
                    the existence of diverse backgrounds, but actively engages and empowers individuals 
                    from these diverse communities. True inclusion necessitates breaking down barriers, 
                    eliminating bias, and fostering an environment where all individuals are treated with 
                    respect and dignity. Through inclusion, we recognize everyone’s right to be.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>The Pitfall of Indoctrination</h2> 
                <p>
                    As indispensable as inclusion is, our lack of understanding of the 
                    concept as led us to misinterpret its true meaning. Regrettably, in 
                    our pursuit of inclusion, we, at times, inadvertently move towards 
                    indoctrination.<br><br>

                    Indoctrination involves the imposition of a specific set of beliefs 
                    and ideas on others, often without allowing critical thinking or dissenting 
                    viewpoints. In simpler terms, it is basically “shoving” your beliefs down people’s 
                    throats. When a person is being indoctrinated, they are manipulated into accepting 
                    and adopting the beliefs of someone else without being allowed to reason for themselves. 
                    This way, their right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion are eroded.<br><br>
                    
                    Indoctrination can occur directly where beliefs are forcefully imposed or indirectly, 
                    masked as the inclusion ‘movement’. It is critical to note that the beliefs and convictions 
                    being dumped on people are not necessarily bad ones. Either way, it takes away the ability 
                    for people to think for themselves and practice what is right by them.
                </p>

                <h2>Differentiating Inclusion From Indoctrination</h2> 
                <p>
                    Over time, the façade of inclusivity has been used to push certain 
                    ideologies, stifling open dialogue and respectful exchange of ideas. 
                    How then do we differentiate inclusion from indoctrination.<br>
                </p>
                
                <h3>1.Respect for personal autonomy:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inclusion values and respects individual autonomy. It allows 
                    people to hold their beliefs and opinions without coercion. 
                    Indoctrination, on the other hand, imposes specific beliefs on others, 
                    room from a debate or critical thinking. Indoctrination takes away the 
                    right of a person to be who they are. Inclusion opens this door.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Encouragement of diverse perspectives:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inclusion embraces diversity. It provides room for creativity and diverse 
                    experiences and ideologies. It understands that we are all different, and 
                    we cannot all think the same and practice the same beliefs. Indoctrination 
                    does not embrace diversity, or identify with it, as it recognizes only one 
                    belief.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Empowerment vs. Manipulation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inclusion empowers people with the environment needed for self-expression 
                    and growth, fostering a sense of belonging and participation. Indoctrination 
                    uses manipulation to persuade people to adopt specific beliefs, discouraging 
                    the exploration of other viewpoints.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Critical thinking and free will:</h3>
                <p>
                    Indoctrination replaces critical thinking and free will with dogma. 
                    It leaves little to no room for independent thought. Inclusion, however, 
                    gives us the freedom to act based on our personal conviction
                </p>

                <h3>5. Openness to debate and change:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inclusion embraces respectful debates, collective thinking, and 
                    welcomes the possibility of change. Indoctrination, however, makes 
                    no room for external opinions, talk more of debates.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Balance and fairness:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inclusion aims at balance and fairness for our vast and diverse world. 
                    It aims to create a level playing field where diverse perspectives are valued. 
                    Indoctrination, however, seeks to dominate. While provision is being made through 
                    inclusion, for voices to be heard and considered, indoctrination takes it all away, 
                    beginning with your right to think.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alex, in the anecdote above, had the purest of intentions. He wanted his religious 
                    beliefs to be recognized and respected. However, he ignored the fact that his 
                    colleagues, themselves, had their religious beliefs which did not necessarily 
                    have to align with his. Partaking in his religious celebration would have 
                    disrespected their religion. A respectful decline in this case in most appropriate.<br><br>

                    This teaches us that we can respect people’s beliefs, culture, and heritage without
                    actively participating in them. The essence of diversity is that we cannot all have
                    the same perspective on every topic. We need to learn to accept this. The fact 
                    that someone doesn’t see things from your standpoint does not make them the enemy.
                    We do not need to force our ideas on anyone. Inclusion is not about choosing sides, 
                    and manipulating others to be on your side. When we do this, it is indoctrination.
                </p>

                        Where I come from, the worst enemy is religion. 
                        Religion is simply a set of principles that guides 
                        our way of life. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines 
                        it as “an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, 
                        and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods”.

                        Growing up as a young child, I would sit with my mum and listen to 
                        songs ranging from gospel, country, reggae, RnB and they were mostly
