          <p>
            Where I come from, the worst enemy is religion. Religion is simply a
            set of principles that guides our way of life. Merriam-Webster
            dictionary defines it as “an organized system of beliefs,
            ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods”.
            This singular institution has influenced and shaped not just the
            beliefs and mindsets of people, but perhaps even the affairs of
            nations. Religion plays an unfathomable role in the civilization and
            development of nations, both in the past and present.
          </p>

          <p>
            Religions achieve their influence either by directly affecting the
            content of a nation’s constitution and laws, or indirectly by
            influencing the individuals who are in power. Either way, people are
            the vehicles used by religion to achieve such influence. Perhaps you
            must have heard that “everything rises and falls with leadership”.
            If you do, then we have something in common because I did too.
            However, the disparity between us might be that I wanted to
            understand what influences leadership and how it is administered. I
            discovered that people are products of their mindsets. So are
            leaders.<br /><br />
            Mindset, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary again, is “a
            particular way of thinking: a person’s attitude or set of opinions
            about something”. Imagine a rural settlement. Imagine this
            settlement having pathways, some leading to the stream, some leading
            to the marketplace, and some to the king’s palace. Now, imagine that
            you want to go to the stream. There is a particular path that you
            would take without having to think it through. Your friend as well,
            from her house, would use a particular path to get to the stream.
            You would not change your default path unless there is a need to.
            The anecdote above is a representation of how the mind works. These
            pathways are mindsets. We tend to have a particular way of thinking,
            without proper consideration. It would be interesting to remind you
            that mindsets are not inborn. They were acquired while growing
            up.,<br /><br />
            Cultures, beliefs, and sentiments that our parents or whoever raised
            us had, form the basic foundation of these mindsets. These
            foundations give us a framework to build upon, and most of the time
            with limited adjustment. A child grows up to be more like his
            parents, believing in what they believe and most likely practicing
            the religion of his parents. I need to remind you that these beliefs
            and religious norms that a child learns do not have to be true,
            right, or generally good. It just has to be acceptable to the family
            and at least a few people outside the family. Remember, the exposure
            or educational status of the parent also is not relevant. This child
            grows up and is sent into society to represent and portray all that
            they have learned in their families and schools. We would be
            fortunate if the child, who becomes a grown-up, was taught to
            respect everyone, irrespective of their religious or political
            affiliation.<br /><br />However, this grown-up becomes a threat to
            peaceful coexistence when they are taught that two or more religions
            are not meant to coexist. It becomes a threat to national unity when
            individuals do not learn that our strength lies in our diversity,
            not our uniformity. It even becomes worse when such a person
            occupies a public office because they would have sentimental and
            favorite tendencies.

          <p>
            Elections into public offices, the appointment of government
            officials, and even admission into institutions become compromised,
            as favoritism is shown along religious lines. Merit and competence
            are being forfeited for religious dominance and over mutual respect
            among religions.<br /><br />
            “Good” and “bad” become synonymous with “my religion” and “their
            religion” as a result of misinformation that started in childhood.
            Human beings are perceived not as such, but can be biased as a
            result of their religious affiliation. This misinformation,
            misunderstanding, and misinterpretation of religion have led to wars
            that should not have been fought, losses that could have been
            avoided, and pains that should never be felt. It costs the
            government: resources, families: property, communities: harmony, and
            individuals: their peace of mind.<br /><br />

            The Covid-19 pandemic has come and gone. One thing I am glad about
            is that it teaches us all a lesson. It teaches us a lesson that
            there is a bigger enemy that does not differentiate between the
            religious affiliation of its victims. It attacks without mercy, and
            its sting pierces into the soul of anyone it can get without
            religious bias. The pandemic has taught us that our strength lies,
            not in our highlighted differences, but in our abilities to use our
            unique diversity to devise sustainable means of defeating our bigger
            enemies. These enemies are not just the pandemic, but also climate
            change, global health issues, hunger, and poverty, among others. We
            must learn that religion is not a tool for creating conflicts and
            trampling over the fundamental human rights of others, but a medium
            for aligning ourselves with a supernatural being that we have faith
            in.<br /><br />
            We must also, as a matter of urgency and for our good, understand
            that at some points, religious leaders and their followers have
            allowed their chauvinistic whims and caprices to cloud their
            judgment about followers of other religions. This has, of course,
            led to false and incomplete teachings that have misled many. I
            believe no religion would choose its dominance over the safety of
            its faithful. That is why we must desist from every form of violence
            and sentiment that arises from religious teachings and poses a
            threat to the peace and harmony that should exist among brothers and
            sisters.<br /><br />
            We must love one another just as we would love ourselves, and we
            must learn to overcome the temptation of giving preferences to
            people of the same religion as ourselves when we know that should
            not be. We must learn rather to teach and encourage that which would
            assist in qualifying the citizens of our nations, in the affairs
            which they pursue. We must also learn that we are not safe when our
            religion is safe, but when our nation is safe because that would
            give us a wonderful avenue to practice our religion without any form
            of fear or worry.

                to songs ranging from gospel, country, reggae, RnB and they were
                mostly oldies. One of such songs I fell in love with was
                “signed, sealed, delivered, I’m yours” by Stevie…
