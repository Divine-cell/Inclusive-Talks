              >A newborn cub loses its mother at childbirth and is adopted by a
              mother sheep. The lion grows up believing that it was a sheep. It
              bleated and ate grass like a sheep. But, it was never truly happy.
              It always felt there was something missing. Plus, the other sheep
              made fun of it for being different. It was called ugly, weird, and
              a disgrace to the sheep community.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            <em
              >One day, an older lion attacked the herd of sheep. While it was
              attacking, it saw the young lion running away along with the other
              sheep. Curious as to what was happening, it decides to go after
              the younger lion. The younger lion, scared for its life, begs the
              older lion not to eat it. The older lion, astonished by the
              ignorance of the younger lion, tells it that it is a lion. But, it
              maintains that it is a sheep.<br /><br />

              The older lion gets an idea. He takes the younger lion to a river,
              asking it to look at its reflection. Upon looking at his
              reflection, the older lion realizes it is a mighty lion. It feels
              so thrilled that it lets out a mighty roar that echoes from all
              the corners of the jungle, bringing fear to the sheep. No longer
              will the sheep be able to make fun of the lion or even stand close
              to it, for it had found its true nature and its true herd. It
              became self-aware. </em
            ><br /><br />

          <h2>What is Self -Awareness?</h2>
          <p>
            Self-awareness is the ability to know and understand your
            individuality. It is experiencing how your thoughts, actions, and
            emotions make you who you are.<br /><br />

            [Self Awareness]The ability to take an honest look into your life
            without attachment to it being right or wrong.<br />
            <em>Debbie Ford</em>.<br /><br />

            In the anecdote, we see that the young lion did not know who it was
            and the power it had because it had never objectively evaluated
            itself. This is why it was unable to align its appearance, emotions,
            and uniqueness from the sheep with its personality. Rather, it took
            on the perception that it was a disgrace to the sheep community.<br /><br />

            Simply put, a self-aware person is one who can interpret his/her
            thoughts, feelings, actions, reactions, and lifestyle objectively to
            understand his/her individuality. Although self-awareness has become
            a buzzword, it is, in fact, a rare skill, especially among young
            people, as most of us have an emotionally driven interpretation of
            who we are. However how rare it is, it is important because it
            allows us to build on our value system and keeps us on target to
            becoming the best version of ourselves.
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Self-Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            We, humans, basically have two personalities: the person we portray
            in public and who we are in private. There are several
            misconceptions about these personalities. Often times, we refer to
            it as being two-faced. The truth is, these two personalities are
            part of human nature. We have our private self and our public self.
            This is why psychologists have split self-awareness into two
            distinct types:<br />
          </p>

          <p>1. Public Self-Awareness</p>
          <p>2. Public Self-Awareness</p>

          <h2>Public Self-Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            This is the awareness we have of ourselves as social beings. It is
            the understanding of how we are perceived by others. Public
            self-awareness involves being conscious of our behavior, appearance,
            and the impression you make on others.<br /><br />

            When we become publicly self-aware, we are more likely to be
            cognizant of how our actions align with social norms, societal
            expectations and the opinion of others. You begin to see yourself as
            the object of attention of others, thereby assessing yourself from
            other people’s perspective. This has its perks. Our value system is
            mostly shaped by society’s norms. Being publicly self-aware helps us
            adopt the right kind of values that will shape you to being a better
            version of ourselves.<br /><br />

            Not withstanding, public self-awareness when left unchecked can
            cause us to lose sight of who we really are. The goal of
            self-awareness is to know who we really are and what we stand for.
            Over the years, the norms of our society have transitioned. When you
            are overly publicly self-aware, your value system changes as
            society’s changes. This means your personality is in flux. Thus, we
            never know who we really are because we are so busy trying to be who
            society wants us to be.
          </p>

          <h2>Private Self-Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            This is the introspective awareness we have of our internal
            thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Who are you when no one is
            looking? This is an important question we have to ask ourselves as
            young people whose identity is still under development. We need to
            be attuned to our thoughts, emotions, motivation, values, and
            everything that makes us who we are.<br /><br />

            Ideally, there should be a degree of alignment between your private
            self and your public self, although total congruence is not always
            necessary. When your private self aligns with your public self, it
            means that the way you perceive yourself is the way you present
            yourself to others. This alignment promotes authenticity in your
            identity. This may not be achieved at adolescence. However, your
            journey through identity development and self-exploration will get
            you there. Through this journey, ensure that the values you align
            with in public agree with the values of your private self.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2>Why is Self-Awareness Important?</h2>
          <p>
            Self-awareness is the same as knowing yourself. In this same sense,
            asking why self-awareness is important is the same as asking why it
            is important to know yourself.<br /><br />
            The overall importance of self-awareness is identity development. As
            a young person, the pressure to meet standards, norms, and
            expectations is overwhelming. Today, we may act like our values are
            independent of the opinion of others’ but it is. It is safe to say
            that there are certain people whose expectations of us help us to
            form our identity. There are also those we look up to forge our
            identity.<br /><br />
            When we are self-aware, we have the understanding of who we are. The
            basis of our identity is already formed. Our fundamental values are
            imbibed in us. This is what we build on. As we grow and go through
            self-exploration, we pick up new habits and values, but our true
            self doesn’t change.<br /><br />
            Moving forward, self-awareness opens your eyes to the kind of things
            that are healthy for you. The right kind of circle, your preferred
            method of achieving your goals, the right career, and generally the
            life that is best suited for you. When you know these things, the
            problems of the world wouldn’t just throw you off track.<br />
          </p>

          <h2>How Do I know If I’m A Self-Aware Person?</h2>
          <p>
            It’s great that you want to know if you’re self-aware and how you
            can improve on this trait. Through self inquiry, asking questions
            and taking a <a href="">self-awareness test</a>, your curiosity can
            be satisfied. The <a href="">iNLP</a> self-awareness test will tell
            you your level of self-awareness and what you can do to improve it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following tips will help you become a more self-aware person in
            your daily life.

          <h3>Engage In Self-Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Set aside time regularly to reflect on your experiences, actions,
            and emotions.
          </p>

          <h3>Embrace Vulnerability</h3>
          <p>
            This deepens your self-awareness and improves your understanding of
            yourself and others.
          </p>

          <h3>Engage In Self-Assessment Tools</h3>
          <p>
            Personality assessments, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
            (MBTI) or the Enneagram, helps you gain insights into your
            personality traits, strengths, and areas for development.
          </p>

          <h3>Seek Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Talk to a variety of people to know and understand their perspective
            of you. This will help you develop a comprehensive view of yourself.
          </p>

          <h3>Continue Learning About Self-Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Read and listen to helpful self-awareness resources.<br />

            Remember, developing self-awareness is a gradual process. It
            requires consistent effort and self-reflection. Be patient with
            yourself and embrace the journey of self-discovery. You’ll get
            there!

                to songs ranging from gospel, country, reggae, RnB and they were
                mostly oldies. One of such songs I fell in love with was
