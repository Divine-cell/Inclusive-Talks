            <em
              >Imagine a beautiful garden with a variety of colorful flowers,
              each with its unique shape, size, color, and fragrance. As you
              walk through the garden, you notice that each flower is distinct.
              Some flowers are tall and graceful, while others are small and
              delicate. Some are vibrant and bold, while others are soft and
              subtle. Together, they create a resplendent tapestry of colors and
              textures that is both awe-inspiring and uplifting.</em
            ><br /><br />

            <em
              >As you take in the beauty of the garden, you realize that the
              diversity of the flowers is what makes it so captivating. Without
              this diversity, the garden would be less beautiful and less
              interesting. Each flower has its unique qualities that contribute
              to the beauty of the garden.</em
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Just like the flowers in the garden, people are diverse in their own
            unique ways. We each have our talents, personalities, and
            experiences that make us who we are. When we come together, we
            create a resplendent tapestry of cultures, beliefs, and perspectives
            that make our world a more beautiful place.<br /><br />

            If diversity didn’t exist, our world would be a dull and boring
            place. Imagine a world where everyone looked the same, spoke the
            same language, and had the same beliefs, values, and ideas. There
            would be no variety or uniqueness. Everything would be monotonous
            and predictable. If life were predictable, it wouldn’t be living.<br /><br />

            Without diversity, our world would be unable to adapt to change.
            Different cultures, beliefs, and ways of thinking provide valuable
            insights that help us to navigate through the challenges of the
            world. It is our different ideas and perspectives that help us solve
            problems. This would be different if we all thought the same way.<br /><br />

            There would be no opportunity for growth without diversity as
            everyone would have the same skills and knowledge. There would be no
            exchange of ideas. Creativity would be a myth. There would be no
            inspiration or motivation to try new things. Everything would be
            stagnant.<br /><br />

            Diversity is like a treasure trove waiting to be harnessed. To fully
            enjoy its benefits, we need to embrace the different perspectives,
            experiences, values, and talents that it offers. The first step to
            embracing diversity is appreciating it.<br /><br />

            We already talked about the blessings that diversity brings. It is
            the identity of our world. The least we could do is be grateful for
            it. How do we express our gratitude for diversity?<br /><br />

            The best way to express gratitude of any kind is to acknowledge it.
            Acknowledge that we are all unique. No two people are exactly alike.
            When we interact with people, we must bear this in mind. By being
            conscious of our differences, inclusion follows.<br /><br />

            Inclusion is the conscious effort to create a welcoming and
            respectful environment where individuals from diverse backgrounds
            feel valued and supported. It is the only true way to show that
            diversity is acknowledged and appreciated.<br />

            Inclusion goes beyond simply tolerating differences. It involves
            actively promoting a culture of openness, empathy, and respect. It
            involves actively working to ensure that all individuals, regardless
            of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, or ability, have
            equal access to opportunities and are treated fairly and
            respectfully. This is the goal of Inclusive Talks carved by Hilda
            Enyioko. We hope to foster a generation grateful for diversity and
            ready to embrace it

                simply a set of principles that guides our way of life.
                Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as “an organized system of
                beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group
                of gods”. This singular institution has influenced and shaped
